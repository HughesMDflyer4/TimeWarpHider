# Time Warp Hider
*Time Warp Hider* is a temporary mod to fix a bug introduced with v0.1.1.0 of Kerbal Space Program 2. As of this update to the game, F2 (or whichever key you have mapped to hide the HUD) hides everything except for the time warp and game view UI elements at the bottom of the screen. This mod simply fixes this.
